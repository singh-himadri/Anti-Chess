# Anti-Chess

Welcome to Anti-Chess! This variant of chess has an intriguing twist: the goal is to lose all your pieces to win the game.

## Objective

The objective of Anti-Chess is to be the first player to have no legal moves left, either by having all pieces captured or by being unable to move any remaining pieces.

## Piece Movement

All pieces move according to standard chess rules:

- **Pawn**: Moves forward one square, captures diagonally forward one square, and can move forward two squares on its first move. It cannot move backward or jump over pieces.
- **Rook**: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically. It cannot jump over other pieces.
- **Knight**: Moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular). It can jump over other pieces.
- **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally. It cannot jump over other pieces.
- **Queen**: Moves any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It cannot jump over other pieces.
- **King**: Moves one square in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

## Mandatory Capture

- If a player can capture an opponent's piece, they must do so. This rule overrides all other potential moves.
- If multiple captures are possible, the player can choose which piece to capture.

## Win Condition

- A player wins by losing all their pieces.
- If a player has no legal moves (either all pieces are captured or remaining pieces cannot move), that player wins.
- If a stalemate situation occurs (a player cannot move any piece), the player who cannot move wins the game.

## Special Rules

- **Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it is promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight, as chosen by the player.
- **Castling**: Castling is not allowed in Anti-Chess.
- **En Passant**: This rule applies as in standard chess.

## Gameplay

1. **Starting the Game**: Decide who plays white and who plays black.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns to move their pieces. White starts first.
3. **Movement**: Each player must move a piece on their turn. If a player has no legal moves, they win.
4. **Capturing**: If a piece can capture, it must do so.
5. **Promotion**: Pawns are promoted upon reaching the opposite end of the board.
6. **Ending the Game**: The game ends when one player loses all their pieces or cannot make any legal move.

## Keeping Track of Moves

- Use a counter to keep track of the number of moves made by each player.

## Notes

- Anti-Chess is a strategic game where the usual goal of capturing the opponent's king is reversed.
- Remember, the key to winning is to lose all your pieces first!
